# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Effect of the of Vaccination Program on the Positivity Rate, Fatality Rate, and Recovery Rate of COVID-19 Cases in DKI Jakarta

English | Indonesian
## Background
As of July 18, 2021, the Covid-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) pandemic has hit Indonesia for 16 months since the Indonesian government announced the discovery of the first two cases of Covid-19 on March 2, 2020. Since then, various efforts have been made by the government. central and local governments to suppress the spread and fatality of Covid-19. The DKI Jakarta Provincial Government has repeatedly implemented Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB), starting from three phases of strict PSBB, transitional PSBB, Implementation of Micro Community Activity Restrictions (PPKM), until finally the government centrally pulled the emergency brake with the Java-Bali Emergency PPKM policy in July 3, 2021.

The start of the national simultaneous vaccination program on January 13, 2021 actually brings hope that the recovery from the pandemic condition can be accelerated. However, the reality seems to be far from that expectation. As of July 19, 2021, DKI Jakarta became the highest contributor of confirmed cases with 727,010 cases or 26.1% of 2,877,476 cases in Indonesia and became the province with the most active positive cases in Indonesia, which was 112,957 cases. This has attracted considerable attention with the emergence of skepticism and negative sentiment among the public regarding the effectiveness of the government's vaccination program. Using a dataset obtained from the official website for the Covid-19 monitoring of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government, corona.jakarta.go.id, we conducted a simple comparative study by carrying out statistical analysis of the pandemic conditions before and after the start of the vaccination program in DKI Jakarta.

## Methods

- Univariate Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Multivariate Analysis
- Statistical Analysis

## Results and Recommendations

A. Results

Based on statistical analysis that was carried out using a dataset from the official website for the Covid-19 monitoring of the DKI Jakarta Provincial Government corona.jakarta.go.id, the following results were obtained:

- If we look at the number of cases (quantity), there has been an increase in the rate of spread (daily positives), fatalities (daily deaths), and recovery (daily recovery) after the simultaneous vaccination program began in DKI Jakarta on January 13, 2021.
- However, relative to the severity of the pandemic condition ('Active Positive') over time, there is a downward trend in the rate of spread (daily positives) and fatalities (daily deaths), while the average daily recovery has increased despite a downward trend after January 13, 2021. This means that , relative to the level of virality of the Covid-19 outbreak in DKI Jakarta, better conditions were obtained after vaccination program was implemented on January 13, 2021.

The important thing to be noted is that due to the limited data available, this analysis only shows the overall condition of the pandemic in DKI Jakarta between before and after vaccination, not measuring the effectiveness of the vaccine itself. The existence of a correlation of increased daily mortality, for example, does not mean causality that vaccines actually increase fatalities. Many other factors influence the three aspects analyzed, ranging from public awareness of health protocols, hospital capacity, to mutations of new variants which are of course beyond the scope of the available datasets.

B. Recommendations

There are several suggestions for further analysis development, including:

- A similar analysis can be done, but with the outliers being handled first on each variable. This needs to be considered because outliers can affect the mean and standard deviation of the data.
- Further analysis can be carried out using more detailed datasets regarding the rate of spread, fatality, and recovery between people who have and have not been vaccinated. Thus, conclusions can be drawn regarding the effectiveness of the vaccination program.
- Deeper analysis which includes other factors in the analysis such as immigration, emigration, hospital capacity, vaccination 1, vaccination 2, to the PSBB and/or PPKM policy timelines taken by the government so that more comprehensive and actual results can be obtained.
